# cocktailFinder-Project
This is a web application I made using HTML, CSS and javaScript(ES6) for this project I used the TheCocktailDB.com API to fetch http request.
# how to use
To use the app simply search any cocktail out of a possible 500+ if you have no ideas click the random button and a random cocktail will appear along with its type, alcoholic content, how to make it and Ingredients with measurements.
